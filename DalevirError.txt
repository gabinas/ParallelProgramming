I recieved this error when instead of dynamically registering a variable i hardcoded the input size, i did this to trouble shoot but i still am having trouble with the local maxes bieng sent to the processor 0.
Error: bsp_put called with an erroneously registered destination variable!
from processor 3 max value is 17
Aborting due to BSP primitive call with invalid arguments.Error: bsp_put called with an erroneously registered destination variable!
Aborting due to BSP primitive call with invalid arguments.Error: bsp_put called with an erroneously registered destination variable!
Aborting due to BSP primitive call with invalid arguments.Segmentation fault (core dumped)



this has been a common error i think it has something to do with the registered variable Maxs I am unable to get the local maxes from Maxs . I read it is because I am pointing to memory that is not allocated but i have allocated it.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
